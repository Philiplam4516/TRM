1. Create a variable named car_name and assign the value Toyota to it.

2. Write a simple program that displays Hello, World! 

3. Declare and use the following variables. Then, display the variable and their data types.
HINT: display variable in one line and display data type in the second line such as:

n1 = 20.5
cNum = 1j
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
MyList = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")
PersonA = {"name" : "John", "age" : 36}
MyFruit = {"apple", "banana", "cherry"}
Items = frozenset({"apple", "banana", "cherry"})
a = True
size= b"Hello"
x = bytearray(5)
mv = memoryview(bytes(5))
4. We have the following variables:

x = 1     # int
y = 2.8  # float
z = 1j    # complex

Convert x to float, y to int, and x to complex. Then, display the new variables and their data types.

5. Write a program that add two numbers such as num1=1.5 and num2=3.2 and stores and display the answer in a variable called result.

6. Write a program to calculate the area of a triangle and display it.

7. Write a program to convert kilometers to miles and display it.

8. Write a program to convert Celsius temperature of 37.5 degree to equivalent Fahrenheit and display it.

9. Evaluate the following expressions and display the results.

2+3*4
7/2
7/2.0
7%2
19%3*4
19%(3*4)
3+8-2*3+7/2
10. Write an expression that adds 5 to the product of 2 and 7. You can also display the result.

11. Write an expression that multiplies the sum of 2 and 7 by 5. You can also display the result.

12. Write a program to calculate the area of a parallelogram and display it. Take the variables as base=5 and height =6.
